# Streamlit Basics

![Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Introduction

This Python project provides a foundation for building interactive data science applications using Streamlit, a powerful library that simplifies the creation of web apps from your Python code.

## What is Streamlit?

Streamlit is an open-source framework that allows you to rapidly prototype and deploy data science applications. It excels at:

- **Minimal Code**: Streamlit lets you create data apps with concise Python code, minimizing boilerplate code for layout and interactivity.
- **Fast Prototyping**: Streamlit is ideal for quickly iterating on app ideas and getting them in front of users for validation.
- **Multi-Widget Apps**: Streamlit supports various input and output widgets like text boxes, sliders, charts, and data tables, enabling user interaction within your apps.

## Getting Started
